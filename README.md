# Crypto Tracker App

A simple crypto tracker app built with `Jetpack Compose`, designed to be 100% responsive using the [Material3](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/) dynamic color theme and `Material3` adaptive navigation. It utilizes the [CoinCap Api](https://docs.coincap.io/) to fetch real-time crypto rates and uses the `Koin` dependency injection library. The primary focus of this project was to create a custom line chart in `Canvas` that displays the changes in crypto rates over the most recent time period.
